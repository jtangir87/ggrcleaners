                        <h2>Cleaning of Soft Goods</h2>
                        <p>Global Garment Restoration & Cleaners has made advancements in soft goods (shoes, sneakers, purses, handbags, stuffed animals, etc.)  restoration.  In the past soft goods that were classified as not repairable can now be restored.  95% of soft goods brought in for restoration can be returned to like-new condition.
                            </p><p>
                            Most soft goods are cleaned in a non-abrasive way.  Washing of goods in cold water and a detergent mixture will loosen any soil or soot that is on the item.  Other specialty or delicate items are cleaned by hand to insure that these soft goods are back to their pre-loss condition. 
                            </p><p>
                            After the items are cleaned they are carefully dried, inspected, and ozoned.  Any remaining damage from smoke or water as well as odors are detected and corrected.  The items are then inspected for a second time, stuffed with tissue and wrapped separately before being boxed for return to the policyholder.
                            </p><p>
                            <strong>Pre-Existing Conditions:</strong>  Not every item can be restored, unfortunately if an item has been severely damaged by the loss it will be impossible to restore to pre-loss condition.  Global Garment Restoration & Cleaners knows that some garments have pre-existing damage which includes but not limited to food stain, paint, moth-holes, tears, missing buttons, snaps-clasps-beads-sequins, broken zippers, discolorations, fading, oxidation, holes, pulls, damaged linings  and garments that cannot withstand the cleaning procedure.  Global Garment Restoration & Cleaners will never charge for a garment that is unable to be restored.

                        <p>Area rugs are generally the most common item affected during a fire and water loss. The cleaning of area rugs requires great detail of attention.

                            The key to cleaning a rug that has been affected by smoke, soot, or water is to understand its construction and delicate fiber material.  Hand woven rugs are each unique, therefore require a specialized cleaning process that best address their individual condition.

                        When the oxygen (O2) that we breathe is all around us rises to the upper atmosphere, and is exposed to the sun’s ultraviolet rays, that oxygen is naturally turned into ozone (O3). That is the “ozone layer” that protects us from the sun’s harmful UV rays. Since ozone weighs more than air it naturally falls back to earth. This is the ozone that purifies our air and water naturally. Without ozone nature could not cleanse and purify our planet.                        </p>

                        Ozone one of the most powerful sterilant in the world and its function is to destroy bacteria, viruses, and odors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ozone cannot be stored or transported because of its unstable tendency to break down quickly, so ozone must be generated on site through an Ozone Generating machine that is enclosed in a room. The ozone process destroys smoke and its inherent impurities plus odors from pets, cooking,  and other household sources.

                            Because gaseous ozone is highly reactive, it readily oxidizes (breaks down) organic matter. When the ozone encounters another compound, one oxygen atom will break away, attach itself to the compound, and oxidize it. Ozone actually breaks down odor causing compounds, thereby eliminating the odor and changing the ozone back to oxygen (O2).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ozone acts substantially faster up to 3000 times than chlorine as a bactericide, and it is the strongest oxidant commercially available for air and water treatment

                                        find our home had been damaged by smoke and most of our electrical appliances ruined.  We called our insurance company and within a few days you arrived at the door.  We were in a state of shock and you and the rest of the restoration team quietly took over.  You were calm, efficient, respectful and very professional.  The smoke damaged articles were removed and within a week returned. Everything was in perfect order, beautifully pressed and you even hung my curtains .
                                        Thank you all for making a difficult situation so much easier for us."

With the recommendation from Royal Family Remediation, GGRC was called in and removed any and all things that were subjected to smoke and toxins.  They did this fast and with great care for our belongings.
                                        Since we have 1 year old twins in the house they made the priority to get the baby stuff back as quickly as possible so that their routine would not be disturbed for many days.  Everything came back clean and smoke free!   The entire team of workers took down drapes, rolled up carpets, took bedding and much more and wonder of wonders put it all back together again!
                                        Again Thank You all and feel free to use my name in the future for new

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                        Global Garment Restoration & Cleaners is the sister company to <a style="color:black;" href="http://www.goroyalnow.com">Royal Family Remediation LLC</a>.  Chris Gulledge Jr. started Royal Family Remediation LLC 6 years ago with the hope of delivering the very highest quality and customer service to the Philadelphia area.  He worked very hard to make Royal Family Remediation LLC. a household name in the area.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4 years ago Chris started to share his knowledge of the business with his wife Irma Gulledge.  He taught her many things about the business, but the two most important lessons he taught her was to treat every customer with courtesy and respect, and to always provide exceptional customer service.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2017 Chris felt it was time for Irma to take over the internal operations of the business.  Irma began taking the company to a new level by providing new services.  One of those services was Restoration Garment Cleaning.  They suddenly became well known in this area of the business due to their exceptional customer service. 
                        <br><br>
                        Global Garment Restoration & Cleaners was created to separate the garment restoration end of the business with the construction and restoration end of the business.  Global Garment Restoration & Cleaners values all the relationships it has developed throughout the years and continues to build and cultivate business relationship.
